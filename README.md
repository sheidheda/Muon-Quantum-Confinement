# Project Title: Quantum Confinement of Muonic Hydrogen-Like Atoms in Semiconductor Quantum Dots

## Introduction

### Background
Artificial atoms, such as semiconductor quantum dots, exhibit discrete energy levels akin to natural atoms. They offer unique properties due to their nanoscale dimensions and controlled electronic structures. Muonic hydrogen, where a muon replaces the electron, presents an exotic scenario due to the muon's heavier mass and shorter lifetime.

### Statement of Problem
The short lifespan of muons poses challenges for their practical applications, such as in muon-catalyzed fusion. This project aims to investigate the lifetime of muons confined in various semiconductor quantum dots, seeking potential solutions to enhance muon stability and utility.

### Significance of Study
Understanding the behavior of muonic hydrogen in confined environments could lead to innovations in nuclear engineering, particularly in enhancing muon stability for more efficient fusion processes.

### Aim of the Study
1. Review and modify the theory of binding energy of muonic hydrogen-like atoms in confined media.
2. Derive an expression for the lifetimes of muonic hydrogen using the Gamow theory of alpha decay.
3. Numerically calculate the lifetimes of muonic hydrogen at different confining lengths.
4. Calculate the confinement energy of muonic hydrogen in various semiconductor quantum dots.
